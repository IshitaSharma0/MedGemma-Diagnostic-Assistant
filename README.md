# ü©∫ MedGemma Diagnostic Assistant

A multimodal AI-powered assistant that uses Google‚Äôs **MedGemma 4B** model to analyze medical images and text prompts for diagnostic insights. This project demonstrates how vision and language can work together to assist in general medical image understanding.

## üöÄ Features
- Accepts both **medical images** (X-ray, skin scans, fractures, etc.) and **text prompts**
- Generates human-like diagnostic responses
- Built with Hugging Face's Transformers and Google‚Äôs MedGemma model
- Runs on **Google Colab with GPU support**
  
## üß† Model Used
- [`google/medgemma-4b-it`](https://huggingface.co/google/medgemma-4b-it)
  
## üì¶ Dependencies
- `transformers`
- `accelerate`
- `bitsandbytes`
- `gradio`
- `torch`
- `PIL`

This project is intended for **research and educational purposes only**.

Please **DO NOT upload any real, identifiable, or sensitive patient data** (such as actual X-ray, CT, or MRI scans containing personal information) to the Google Colab notebook or any public cloud environment linked to this repository.

If you choose to test the model, ensure that:

- The medical images are **fully anonymized**
- No **personally identifiable information (PII)** is present in the image or its metadata
- You are in full compliance with your region's data protection regulations  
  _(e.g., **DPDPA 2023** in India, **HIPAA** in the U.S., or **GDPR** in the EU)_
